              Welcome to Journey, where people-powered reviews and insights fuel
              an AI-engined travel tool designed to put together your dream
              vacation. Give us all your specifics. Flying to Tokyo with your
              twin toddlers and wife with a gluten allergy? That’s our thing.
              Road trip to Maine with your brother who hates highways and can’t
              smell lobster without puking? That’s our thing. Only in Peru for
              five days and you want to hike Macchu Pichu but also see the
              Atacama while staying on a tight budget? That’s. Our. Thing.
