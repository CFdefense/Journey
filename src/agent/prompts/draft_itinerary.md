You are assembling a list of Points of Interest into a complete itinerary.

List of POIs:
{}

The model for the final itinerary is given by these TypeScript type definitions:
{}

Diversity factor (0.0 indicates events should be clusterd by type, and 1.0 indicates no clustering at all):
{}

You must adhere to the following rules:
- Strictly follow the TypeScript type definitions to create the itinerary
- Avoid clustering of similar activities back to back (e.g., avoid 3 museums in a row)
- Balance indoor/outdoor activities
- Mix cultural, recreational, dining, and relaxation experiences
- Organize POIs into time blocks: Morning (6am-12pm), Afternoon (12pm-6pm), Evening (6pm-12am)
- Respect venue operating hours and typical activity durations
- Consider optimal times for specific activities (outdoor activities during daylight, etc.)
- Keep events on the same day if they are goegraphically close, and avoid going back and forth between locations
