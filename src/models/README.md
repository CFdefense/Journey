/*
 * src/models
 *
 * This directory contains models used to represent data from the
 * database tables in the application. Each Rust struct here mirrors a
 * table schema and is used throughout the backend for typed access.
 *
 * It also contains request/response payload types used by our HTTP API,
 * enabling clear serialization and deserialization across endpoints.
